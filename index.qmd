## About Me

*☀️ Researcher by day | 🌙 Artist by night*

Hi I'm Najla 👋 
I'm a Research Associate and PhD student at [Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (IMBEI)](https://www.unimedizin-mainz.de/imbei/), [University Medical Center Mainz](https://www.unimedizin-mainz.de/), Germany, with a background in biology and a focus on bioinformatics. My research centers on analyzing omics data, particularly transcriptomics, and developing R packages to help biologists in uncovering biological insights. Outside of work, I’m a self-taught digital artist who loves creating colorful illustrations and finding inspiration in nature.
