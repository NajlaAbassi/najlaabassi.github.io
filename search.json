    "text": "first article ._. cause this was the highlight of my day\nhow to perform functional enrichment analysis?\nAs I‚Äôm writing, I never performed functional enrichment analysis on single cell data before. However the concept should be the same with bulk data! I‚Äôm going to walk you through the steps and the tools I used in analyzing single cell data.\nfunctional enrichment analysis is a bioinformatics procedure that aims to identify the biological implications in a list of genes, usually being DEGs. In simply words (becuase why not), after generating large tables of DEGs, we want to know and understand in which biological pathways these genes are involved. There are several statistical methods that can be used to associate the most enriched biological pathways in the input gene list.\nTODO: tolk abt the different tools topGO, clusterPro ‚Ä¶ (this is an opportunity to read about them in more details)\nTODO: visualization, potentially using ggplot, genetonic, and maybe explore something else??\nTODO: highlight: by using genetonic you get the z score: which corresponds to\nTODO: maybe find an example of public data, and hopefully try to replicate the findings of the orignial authors, try add my personal touch, like i will be generating different plots using my own perspective, but eventually leading to the same conclusion. this is an opportunity to exploit my brain both as a biologist and a bioinformatician üòà. after all the goal of this is to teach bioinformatics ‚Äúas bioinformatician‚Äù but from the perspective of a biologist"
