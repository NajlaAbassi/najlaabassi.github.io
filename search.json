But I just wanted to emphasize on how important it is to document everything around your research, not just the raw data, but the context, the commands, the decisions. That‚Äôs metadata too.\nI‚Äôm a Bioinformatics PhD student, and I just wanted to share my humble experience on what I do to document my work."

    "text": "What do I document?\nHonestly? Everything.\nNot just code, but all the tricky setup steps that no one talks about. Things like how to configure your laptop for bioinformatics work, set up the office printer (which could be tricky sometimes), or access the HPC cluster.\nThese are the kinds of things I was lucky to get help with early on, my supervisor guided me through a lot of the setup. But timing doesn‚Äôt always work out like that for everyone, so I started documenting these steps to make things easier for the next person (and for future me too).\nIt‚Äôs true that I sometimes forget to document in the moment. But every time I revisit my notes and they save me, I‚Äôm reminded just how valuable good documentation is.\nSo, no, it doesn‚Äôt take much time to just document on the fly. And trust me: ‚Äúlater‚Äù sometimes might never happen."

    "text": "How do I document?\n\n‚òÄÔ∏è Start with clarity\n\nI start every project with a context block, where I describe the aim of the analysis and the experimental design. It helps me actually understand what we‚Äôre trying to find or observe. This one might be personal since I‚Äôm also a biologist by training, so I like to make sure there‚Äôs a clear link between the data and the biological insight.\nI always write documentation as if I know nothing about what I‚Äôm documenting. That forces me to include as many details as possible, so when future me checks the notes, it‚Äôs guaranteed to be understandable.\nI also document failed experiments, and what I did to save the day. This is especially helpful in case someone else runs into the same issues, and honestly, even for me when I run into similar problems later.\n\n\n\nüìÅ Stay organized\n\nI have a consistent folder structure (I personally use Google Drive and SeaFile, but I‚Äôve seen people use other clouds, save locally, on a server, and that‚Äôs all fine). This helps me document on the fly without overthinking where to save or how to name things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of my learning notes include ‚Äú101‚Äù in the file name. So when I need to find something quickly, I just type 101 in the search bar and rely on autocompletion.\n\n‚Üí So yeah, give your notes meaningful & searchable names!\n\nI number my R Markdown files so that, in the future (or for collaborators), it‚Äôs clear which one to check first. I usually separate them by pipeline steps, e.g one .Rmd for preprocessing scRNAseq data, one for integration, one for annotation and so on. So if I have files like 04-1-DE_analysis.Rmd and 04-2-Annotate_Monocytes.Rmd, I know the annotation came after the first round of Differential Expression Analysis.\nA cool idea I learned from my supervisor: create a README file for each project. Include all the relevant info, e.g.¬†where the raw data is stored, how to run the scripts/notebooks, and what decisions were made.\n\nIn the end, it‚Äôs not the longest list of tips, but I hope it‚Äôs enough to spark some inspiration and help you find what works best for you üòä\nThis is my first blog entry using Quarto, and nothing is perfect the first time XD. What matters is taking action ü§ó\nStay safe, and keep documenting ‚ù§Ô∏è"

    "text": "first article ._. cause this was the highlight of my day\nhow to perform functional enrichment analysis?\nAs I‚Äôm writing, I never performed functional enrichment analysis on single cell data before. However the concept should be the same with bulk data! I‚Äôm going to walk you through the steps and the tools I used in analyzing single cell data.\nfunctional enrichment analysis is a bioinformatics procedure that aims to identify the biological implications in a list of genes, usually being DEGs. In simply words (becuase why not), after generating large tables of DEGs, we want to know and understand in which biological pathways these genes are involved. There are several statistical methods that can be used to associate the most enriched biological pathways in the input gene list.\nTODO: tolk abt the different tools topGO, clusterPro ‚Ä¶ (this is an opportunity to read about them in more details)\nTODO: visualization, potentially using ggplot, genetonic, and maybe explore something else??\nTODO: highlight: by using genetonic you get the z score: which corresponds to\nTODO: maybe find an example of public data, and hopefully try to replicate the findings of the orignial authors, try add my personal touch, like i will be generating different plots using my own perspective, but eventually leading to the same conclusion. this is an opportunity to exploit my brain both as a biologist and a bioinformatician üòà. after all the goal of this is to teach bioinformatics ‚Äúas bioinformatician‚Äù but from the perspective of a biologist\n\n\n\n Back to top"
